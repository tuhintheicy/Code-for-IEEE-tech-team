 <p style="color:blue;"><i>The day kickstarted off with introduction to the overall functioning of the IEEE JUSB by the officeholders.Then began the workshop with
     briefing on how the ML and AL works exactly and how it's code are written and what is Google collab all about.Then came the detailing of model training
     and showing of an example of machine learning program of handwriting recognition by Biparnak Roy, one of our senior and the Secretary of IEEE JUSB.That was
     indeed a hands-on experience in ML coding for many peeps. There were much enthusiasm among the UG1 fellas who were the among the learners mainly.
     Then there was a lunch break after which one of our super senior and ML expert who was also an Alumni of JU,
     <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisg04">Krishnachur Ghosh (click on the name to get access of the linkedin account)</a>, shared his knowledge
     on application of ML in various domains of our life, the session being quite interactive . Then a Hackathon was organized where basically people had to play with 
     data on Fashion items and train the data. This was basically brainstorming on the data and little bit of code to increase the accuracy of the model.Latly certificates 
     of participation was given out to all the participants followed by giving away of the winner's prize and the Runner up's prize . The winner was Parthib Dhali and runner up was 
     Tahera Bano respectively. After that the workshop was concluded with a load of memories and a bunch of knowledge.</i></p>
